<h1 align=center> Introduction üö© </h1>

  <p align="center">
    Since the pandemic, almost everything has moved to the virtual world, and so has <b>education</b>. All our classes have been moved online, and with that, all our <b><em>assignments, tests, exams, and viva</b></em> are being held on an online platform as well. With so many <b><em>assignment deadlines, upcoming exam dates, and being busy with our lives</b></em>, we often forget the deadlines and exam dates. I don't know how many of you can relate, but it happens to me frequently. So, I came up with this <b>app</b>, which once fed with all the required data, will remind you of the <b><em>assignment deadlines, upcoming exams, and unfinished homework</b></em>. This way, you can plan your schedule accordingly.
