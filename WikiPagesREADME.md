<h3 align="center">ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of This Project</h3>

#### The pandemic has made almost everything move on to the virtual world and so has <b>Education</b>. All of our classes have moved online and with that, all of our<b><em> assignments, tests, exams, viva</b></em> are held on the online platforms. With so many <b><em>assignment deadlines, upcoming exam dates, and being busy with our life chores</b></em>, we forget the deadlines and exam dates on most occasions. I don't know how many of you, but it happens to me frequently. So, I came up with this <b>app</b> which once fed with all the required data it'll remind you of the <b><em>assignment deadlines, upcoming exams, unfinished homework</b></em>. So, you can plan your schedule accordingly.
